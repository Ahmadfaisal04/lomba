Hello my name is AHMAD FAISAL, I am from Planet Earth, just contact me via Telegram or Instagram,
I am here to survive in a world full of smog.
As the Russian philosopher Ayn Rand once said "If smog becomes a risk to human safety then you must always remember, that life in nature without technology is certain death".
